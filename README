==================================================================

== PURPOSE ==

The biblatex-publist package provides a biblatex bibliography
style file (*.bbx) for publication lists, i.e. a bibliography
containing one's own publications. The style file draws on
biblatex's authoryear style, but provides some extra features
needed for publication lists, such as the omission of the own
name from author or editor data.

The package requires at least version 3.4 of the biblatex
package.


== CONTENTS ==

The package consists of the following files:

* publist.bbx (biblatex bibliography style file)
* publist.cbx (biblatex citation style file)
* biblatex-publist.pdf (package documentation)
* biblatex-publist.tex (documentation source)
* README (this very file)


== DOCUMENTATION ==

See the included manual biblatex-publist.pdf for usage
instructions.
