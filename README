==================================================================

== PURPOSE ==

The biblatex-publist package provides a biblatex bibliography
style file (*.bbx) for publication lists, i.e. a bibliography
containing one's own publications. The style file draws on
biblatex's authoryear style per default (which can be changed),
but provides some extra features needed for publication lists,
such as the omission of the own name from author or editor data.

The package requires at least version 3.4 of the biblatex
package.


== CONTENTS ==

The package consists of the following files:

* publist.bbx (biblatex bibliography style file)
* publist.cbx (biblatex citation style file)
* publist.dbx (biblatex database model file)
* biblatex-publist.pdf (package documentation)
* biblatex-publist.tex (documentation source)
* README (this very file)


== DOCUMENTATION ==

See the included manual biblatex-publist.pdf for usage
instructions.

	- Rename some macros, using pseudo-namespaces:
		* date:makedate => bpl:date:makedate
	    	* date:labelyear+extrayear => bpl:date:labeldate+extradate
	    	* marginyear => bpl:marginyear
	    	* rauthor => bpl:review:author

	    	* year+labelyear => bpl:year+labelyear

* V. 1.7 (2017-04-12):
        - Output marginyear before the author list. This prevents it from being vertically
          shifted in case of long author lists.

* V. 1.6 (2017-04-02):
	- New option 'nameorder' that allows to change the ordering of author and editor
	  name ("given-family" vs. "family-given" [= default]).

	  "highlight").
	- New command \plauthorhl that determines the aforementioned highlighting.
	- Rename \omitname to \plauthorname (the old macro is still functional,
	  but marked as deprecated).

	  but marked as deprecated).
	- Assure the margin text always starts uppercased (relevant for pubstates).
	- Minor corrections to the manual.

* V. 1.3 (2016-08-06):
	- It is now possible to change the base style that is used.
	- Proper sorting of pubstates.
	- Add possibility to increase the indentation of items (by means
          of the length extralabelnumberwidth).
	- Use pagetracker=true instead of pagetracker=spread by default
	  (avoids warning, no change in functionality).

* V. 1.2 (2016-05-12):
	- Accomodate to the backwards-incompatible changes of biblatex 3.4
	  (prefixnumber > labelprefix, \ifempty > \ifdefvoid).
	  This version of biblatex is now required.

* V. 1.1 (2016-03-09):
	- Adapt to the \Declare*Name changes of biblatex 3.3.

* V. 1.0 (2015-01-04):

	- Support name prefix in \omitname.

	  times without refsection.

	  non-ASCII characters encoded with LaTeX macros).
	- Add \omitname command.
